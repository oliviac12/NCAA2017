This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
season_c <- read.csv('RegularSeasonCompactResults.csv')
season_d <- read.csv('RegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv')
season <- read.csv('Seasons.csv')
team <- read.csv('Teams.csv')
tourney_c <- read.csv('TourneyCompactResults.csv')
tourney_d <- read.csv('TourneyDetailedResults.csv')
tourneySeed <- read.csv('TourneySeeds.csv')
tourneySlot <- read.csv('TourneySlots.csv')
```

```{r}
season_matches <- tourneyRes[which(tourneyRes$season == "A"), ]
team <- vector()
result <- vector()
for(i in c(1:nrow(season_matches))) {
  row <- season_matches[i, ]
  if(row$wteam < row$lteam) {
    vector <- paste("A","_",row$wteam,"_", row$lteam, sep ="")
    team <- c(team, vector)
    result <- c(result, 1)
  } else {
    oth <- paste("A", "_", row$lteam, "_", row$wteam, sep ="")
    team <- c(team, oth)
    result <- c(result, 0)
  }
}
train_data_frame <- data.frame("Matchup" = team, "Win" = result)
head(train_data_frame)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
